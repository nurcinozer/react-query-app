# React Query Movies/Series App

Previously, I worked with `useContext` and `Redux` for state management and they can be a bit difficult in React. However, `React Query` can deal with all data, make sure it's cached, re-fetching it when needed and the list goes on.

So, that's why I built a list with movies and series. When we click on one of them, it loads that specific categories' details. The first time you see it, it will show a loading indicator, but on a second return, it's neatly cached and shows the content immediately.

## Installation

```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Usage

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Credits

I got the data and project details from [Pankod Frontend Challenge](https://github.com/pankod/frontend-challenge).
